Within the first sheet we can see there is a high amount of individuals that patronize the bike-sharing service. Within the second chart we see that though the service is utilized more by males on average women use the service for longer hour durations. 
        Within the fourth chart you can see on a weekly basis the service is utilized heavily in the early and later hours of the day with a decline midday, this may be due to the demographic needing to carry out their other daily activities and responsibilities through the daily hours. However, there is a spike following that during the evening hours. You can also denote the closer we get to the weekend, the more people use service.  
        Based of the Gender in the Second Sheet we can see that the male gender within the demographic are those most willing to use service which would explain why in the fifth sheet we can see the males are most willing to subscribe to service as opposed to the females which would much rather use service on a convenient basis when there is need. 
        In conclusion of my analysis this would be a good opportunity to get in an active market that sees its service in high demand currently indicating a potential opportunity to invest in the bike-sharing service.
